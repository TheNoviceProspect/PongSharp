# PongSharp

This is a simple (I hope) implementation of Pong in CSharp.

I'm using Raylib as the underlying gfx library.

Please remember that I am a hobbyist trying his hand at progamming, not an actual dev.

## Build and run

Clone this repository, and then run

`dotnet restore; dotnet build --no-restore && dotnet run --project ./src/PongSharp.App.csproj`
